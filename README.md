# Unit-19-React-Homework-Employee-Directory
The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with REACT. The assignment was to create a table that was populated with data gathered from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) API. This app contains a very basic home page as a place holder and a Roster page that actually satisfies the acceptance criteria of the assignment. 

The Roster page populates a lightly styled table with data gathered from the aforementioned API. A user can sort the table by Nationality or filter by name using the search field.

# Future Plans
- Fix the semi wonky deployment
- Make each field name into a link to sort by relevant data
- Add logic to take care of special characters in the search field
- make the search more forgiving to typos ect.
- fix the minor css issues
